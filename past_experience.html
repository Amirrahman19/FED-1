        <p style="text-align: left" class="text-small">In the past, I used to code during my free time as I still had to study my 9 different 
          subjects before O-levels. However, I became more immersed in coding after being enrolled in ALP, so I actually put in more time and effort
          into programming a Microbit to control my 3-D printed structre as effectively as possible. I also happened to be selected to present my 
          knowledge of programming Microbits and several other 3-D printed projects at the Excel Fest 2019. I also created a basic website for my 
          <a href="https://f39c9-amirrahman.my.cclb.io/"><abbr title="Values In Action">VIA Programme</abbr></a>, to present something different and interesting to the school.</p> 
          
          <br />
        
        <p style="text-align: left" class="text-small">Apart from that I also participated in the <abbr title="Youth Cyber Exploration Programme">
          YCEP</abbr> which was organised by the <abbr title="Cyber Security Agency of Singapore">CSA</abbr> and hosted by RP. I learnt a variety of 
          things from how to use a software called the VMware Workstation to mimic how certain operating systems work so that we could communicate 
          between computers running on iOS and Windows via the Terminal and Command Prompt respectively. It was an interesting experience as that was
          where I also learnt about network traffic and how to track the network packets and signals that my computer was receiving using tools 
          such as Wireshark and Netstat. During mu holidays after my O-levels however, due to COVID, I was not able to travel overseas for the six long months of holiday given to us. So to make the most 
          use of my time, I decided to start self learning programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

          most of the time in Secondary School, we were guided thoroughly in our subjects and revision. However, my lack of independent learning experience
          certainly did not serve as a significant obstacle to get a solid grasp of the programming.</b></p> -->

        <p>Moreover, since I am fluent in English and my Mother Tongue which is Tamil, I enrolled in Higher Tamil as soon as I was in Secondary 2. Thanks to this upgrade in my Mothertongue education, I was given the 
        opportunity to interview a very well-known writer, Mr Shanavas who essentially gave us his life story starting from when he was in India. My teacher, a friend and I worked on 
      transforming this interesting and invaluable interview into an article regarding him and the article was published in a book called Tamil 200 where I am part of the list of writers
    mentioned in the book. Moreover, during our holidays in Sec 2, I was also given the opportunity along with some selected students from my Sec 2 Tamil cohort, to go on an ImmersionTrip to India.
  The trip was another wonderful experience and I was so fascinated by it that I even decided to write an article about it and publish it in a well-known Tamil magazine knows as the 'Serangoon Times'.</p>
          <br />
        
          <p>In secondary school, I had a wonderful experience in my CCA, NPCC(National Police Cadet Corps). I had fun learning how to tie different types of knots which would later be applied to campcraft for which
            I also attended competitions. I also participated actively during our physical training and was always working on how to save energy and run a longer distance. Apart from these, I also participated in one of the best
            events that UG(Uniform Groups) had to offer--CAMPS! We mostly used Pulau Ubin as the venue but during all my camps, in school as well as in Pulau Ubin, I learnt many values, made many friends and definitely learnt many
            new street smart skills. Moreover, upon rising to Secondary 3, our seniors had to step down in preparation for their O-levels. Thus my Sec 3 unit had to come up with our Executive Committee consisting of 6 members. After
            a proper voting process, I eventually got selected as 'Head of Planning' of my unit. Thereafter, I had to work with all the other EXCO members as a leader to organise our CCA's weekly trainings and it was my responsibility to 
            plan the trainings well.
