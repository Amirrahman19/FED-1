        <p style="text-align: left" class="text-small">Presently, I am really enjoying my lessons in SP. The teachers are engaging, kind and caring. 
          My classmates are also very helpful and we get along well. When everyone helps each other out, the class as a whole rises up. The method 
          of grading us through weekly graded quizzes is smart and rather helpful as we get to test ourselves after every topic so that our grasp on 
          the topic is solid. This way, to me, once its time for our <abbr>Mid-Semester Test</abbr>(MST), the class will be very prepared for the exams 
          due to the need for weekly revision since the first week of school.</p>

          <br/> 
         <p>I have made many good friends, who are very helpful to each other, both socially and academically. My teachers are especially amazing as 
           they help us out readily whenever we need their help or have difficulty understanding a concept. My modules are also exciting as I learn a mountain
           of information every lesson and I apply the knowledge in many creative ways through assignements and conversations.</p> 
         <br />  
         <p>My friends and I hang out, following covid restrictions but when we do, we discuss about studies and joke around maturely thus making my current group 
          of friends reliable and perfect for me. My experience in school has been rewarding so far. Most of the lessons are project based through which I have learnt 
          to appreciate the strengths of my classmates and how we can complement one another in ensuring that the project is does effectively. It is amazing how
          skilled my classmates are and I am glad to also be able to contribute fully in discussions both in class and privately with my own group of friends. 
          This course is a concentration of like-minded individuals with the drive and passion towards AI and computing. As such, our conversations are always very rich and 
          there is always a lot of value added as we continuously learn from one another.</p>
