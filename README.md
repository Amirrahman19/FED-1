# FED-1
Front-end web development school project 1

This is my first FED project that I made for school and I am displaying it here if anyone is looking for creative ideas to design your site. This site does not include any JS only HTML and CSS. The css files are named according to the html files so the main.html is linked to 01.css and past to 02.css, current to 03.css, course to 04.css and feedback to 05.css.

Let me know what you think and hope you enjoy viewing the site!
