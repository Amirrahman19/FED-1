        <h2>FED</h2>
        <p>This website was created for this module (Front-end web development). In this module, we learnt HTML(Hypertext
          Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets). These are the two main languages used for developing sites that have no relation to databases and 
          are simply static websites for users to look at and browse through. This module is exciting, as, personally, it pushes my level of creativity to
          the max and makes me think of different ways to attract one's eye in terms of content, color and presentation. Our current teacher, Mr Lim, has much experience in web development
          and this makes his teaching easily understandable and relatable. I have also learnt a lot of different new codes for HTML and CSS through Cengage, Mindtap, 
          Coding Challenges. Some really interesting codes we learnt were how to create tables, how to achieve a linear gradient color and how to apply box shadowing or border
          coloring, just to name a few. Since, my teacher uses Mindtap to conduct lessons, the lessons are very well planned and structured so it is easy to follow because
          he goes through the coding challenges one by one, explaining every line of code to us. We also get ample time to ask him qns after understanding the codes and finally apply it to 
          this project. I've enjoyed the lessons and building this website thoroughly.

        <h2>FOP</h2>
        <p>(Fundamentals of Programming) is an exciting module where for the first semester, we learn Javascript and apply the language to different situations.
          The lessons are engaging, the teachers are very helpful and most importantly the programming language itself is fun to learn. My current teacher, Ms Wong, is
          an excellent teacher who has tons of experience and also patiently asks for questions and answers them during tutorials and practicals.</p>

      <div class="box s1-b">
        <h2>CAT</h2>
        <p>
          (Critical and Analaytical Thinking) is an intriguing module that basically teaches you how to think and understand the depths of an issue and come up with evidence or reasons to 
          support the claim of the author who wrote the article which serves as the evidence. This module requires one crucial thing and that is a stakeholder whereby whatever evidence we 
          source for needs to talk about our respective stakeholder.
        </p>
        
       
      </div>
      <div class="box s1-c">
        <h2>MATH</h2>
        <p>This is rather obviously an interesting subject and my favourite one too ever since Secondary School. We learn about matrices, binary conversion and 
          set and venn diagrams(like from e-math in secondary school). This subject will never cease to amaze me as no matter how difficult a test or quiz is, if I am careful
          and check my work and do my working correctly, getting full marks is perfectly possible for anyone.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box s1-d">
        <h2>FOC</h2>
        <p>(Fundamentals of Computing) is also a very interesting and fun module as we learn basically more about Computers, networks and how computers communicate with each other
          and how data is transferred, etc. This module is interesting as I got to learn about a lot of things for which I did not know the reason whenever something really went wrong with
          my computer in the past, such as why my computer suddenly doesnt start up or how to choose a computer that 'works faster' to suit our needs like gaming, movie creation or programming
          (related to CPU and RAM).

        <hr />
        <h2>CPR</h2>
        <p>(Communicating for Project Effectiveness) is a module where we come up with an issue and look for evidence to prove that it is an actual problem recognised nationally or internationally.
          Then we have to input our information in different sections like product speciality, problem description, tech specfications and unique additions to the product. This requires proper teamwork
          as everyone in the group as to work together at the same pace to get their respective assigned sections done promptly.

        <hr />
        <h2>ECG</h2>
        <p>(Education and Career Guidance) is like a form-teacher module(like in Secondary School) where we go into MySkillsFuture.sg and complete assessments that 'describe' or 'define' who we are based on short
          surveys and questionnaires. It's actually fun when you see the result you get though the actual questionnaire is kind of boring._.

        <h2>In conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Diploma in Applied AI and Analytics (DAAA) curriculum has 2 key thrusts, both of which I find personally interesting and highly relevant to SG’s Smart Nation concept. Firstly, it provides a solid foundation for understanding data systems as they are today – how data is held, processed, and analysed. Secondly, it provides a clear picture of how Artificial Intelligence (AI), arguably the most disruptive technology in data science in recent years, should be can be used for social benefit.</p>   
        <hr />
        <hr />
        <p>There is an unprecedented amount of information generated in the world we live in today – simultaneously and from multiple sources. I believe that this necessitates the need for a strong ability to assimilate and harness this data, to best understand the increasingly complex world that they come from. Through this curriculum, which focuses on managing large datasets, I would like to learn how to hone my problem solving skills and use the right algorithms to grapple with the multifarious and complex data from the real world, to gain insights and by thinking analytically while looking at various pieces of data from cause to effect to draw a conclusion.</p>    
        <hr />      
        <!-- <p>Furthermore, this Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need for utilising technology to enable a more resilient and high-bandwidth communications network, to overcome the challenges of working from home. While the pandemic laid bare our vulnerabilities both as individuals as well as a country, it also accelerated many of the trends, like digitalisation; a McKinsey global survey of executives stated that digitization has accelerated by 4 to 5 years. Digital adoption has taken a quantum leap at personal, organisational and industry levels due to the pandemic. Consumers have shifted towards online channels with companies and industries responding in turn. 
          At least 80% of customer interaction are digital in nature. While in the short term, Covid has hit the economy harshly, it is clear that the long term effects for economy may very well be positive through strategic adaptation of digital technology as a critical component of transformation in the new normal.</p>   -->
        <hr />   
        <p>While embracing digital technology is thrilling, I believe that AI should also be human centric with importance placed on unbiased data analysis and an appropriate degree of human involvement. I plan on leveraging on my strengths which is clarity in communication, networking and listening to people’s needs to guide me in being the link between the exciting world of digital technology and the end users, be it the digital natives or our pioneers. To do this, I made the decision to join DAAA, which is probably one of the best choices I have made so far.</p>  
        <hr /> 
        <hr />  
        <p>The AI revolution has led to an increase in the demand for data analysts and artificial intelligence practitioners, a community I aspire to be a part of and make significant contributions to as I believe it can dramatically improve the efficiencies of our workplaces and can augment the work humans can do. As Singapore develops its digital capabilities, be it for economic, defence, or other reasons, I am highly keen to be part of this exciting area of work.  I am enrolled into this course so that I can perform at my best in what I am interested and believe in. I am determined to pursue computer science as a major in an industry-leading university, and with further study and industrial work thereafter.</p>
