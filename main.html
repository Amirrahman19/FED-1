                        I'm 17 years old studying in Singapore Polytechnic, DAAA(Diploma in Applied AI and Analytics). I am someone who is naturally interested 
                        in coding and AI, which is also the main reason why I decided to pursue my passion and join this course. I prefer to think of myself as a person  
                        who is thirsty for knowledge. I joined DAAA as I had some prior experience in coding and programming but my interest in this field
                        first sparked when I was in Sec 2 and my class was enrolled in the <abbr title="Applied Learning Programme">ALP</abbr>. It was 
                        during this programme that I first heard of and learnt to use Javascript. I used the Microbit as a tool to apply to my perfumery project. I am also 
                        familiar with Python, HTML and CSS.
                        <br>
                        
                
                  The main reason why I joined DAAA, was not because of any of my prior experience but because I like to solve problems using data.
                    So far, in my case, this has only been possible with Mathematics.
                    However, taking the current COVID situation for example, I like to study and explore the data and patterns of the number of deaths and cases provided by the internet
                    to derive a conclusion about what we can do to prevent the pattern from continuing in real life. I am solution-focused and am a firm believer of possibility thinking.
         
                     <br>   
                       
         I've had the opportunity, during my six-month long holiday, to explore the world on the internet and discover many resources that
         are readily available to help us in the designing and programming field.

                  <p>I like travelling overseas and have been to several amazing countries such as Paris, France; London, England; Chennai, India; Scotland and Johor Bahru, Malaysia.
                    I personally like cold countries and so I cherish every time I've been to London, Scotland and Paris as now due to COVID-19, we may not be able to travel for a very long time.
                    However, I still like exploring the world in other ways like surfing the internet and reading global news related to this country. I have always wanted to visit Australia and I 
                    hope I can after graduating from SP.

                  <p text-align="right">I am very OCD the way my work is completed whereby if I am not satisfied with the quality of my work then I cannot relax until it meets my expectations.
                    This is natural since Primary School, continuing onto to Secondary School, where when the class is assigned group work, I always push for proper statistics 
                    and grammar as I am usually representing the group. This way, whatever the end result of the project work, I am proud of myself and my group. I achieved this mindset after watching
                  'The Big Bang Theory' and the best actor Sheldon Cooper who inspired me to be more ever since a long time ago!</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Moreover, I also recently start listening to music a lot since Sec 3 as it helped me calm down and focus on my studies. My favorite artists are DJ Khaled, Flux Pavillion, Whiz Khalifa,
                    2NE1, Blackpink, 4minutes and my most favourite and latest discovery: Jasmine Sokko.

                <p align="left">In my free time, I like to program and do sports. As for sports, I like to run and cycle as well as play badminton.
                  I also recently took up Judo as ever since my o-levels, I have not had the chance to exercise properly as Physical Education(PE) lessons were stopped even 
                  before O-levels due to COVID-19 but I still cycle more often with my personal beast of a bicycle:"Rockrider" I like to code and work on mini projects whenever I'm free as well as work on Math problems to keep my brain working.</p>   
                <br />
                  <p>Moreover, I like to keep up with latest tech news through 'Emerj Artificial Inc.' and other sites meant for programmers. I also keep up with global news through the 
                  'Economist' magazine, which although requires a monthly paid subscription, comes with lots of very clearly explained news from all around the world. This magazine
                  is my favourite as it covers crucial sections, from business to world economics to tech news to general news as well as even statistics for stock prices!</p>
